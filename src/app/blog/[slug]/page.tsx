      <p>Mobile-first design isn't just a trendâ€”it's a necessity. With over 60% of web traffic coming from mobile devices, your website must prioritize mobile experience.</p>
      
      <h2>What is Mobile-First Design?</h2>
      <p>Mobile-first design means designing for mobile devices first, then scaling up to larger screens. This approach ensures optimal performance across all devices.</p>
      
      <h2>Why Mobile-First Matters</h2>
      <h3>1. Google's Mobile-First Indexing</h3>
      <p>Google primarily uses mobile versions of websites for indexing and ranking, making mobile optimization crucial for SEO.</p>
      
      <h3>2. User Experience</h3>
      <p>Mobile users expect fast, intuitive experiences. Poor mobile design leads to high bounce rates and lost customers.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Performance Benefits</h3>
      <p>Mobile-first design forces developers to prioritize essential content and optimize performance from the ground up.</p>
      
      <p>LogiBrix ensures all websites are built with mobile-first principles for maximum reach and engagement.</p>
